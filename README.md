# self_practise
Welcome to my self_practise repository! This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems that I solve on daily basis. The primary objective of this project is to improve my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of algorithms and data structures.

## Repository Structure
- Each problem's solution is stored in a dedicated folder named after the problem's title.
- The folder contains:
  - Solution Code: The implementation of the solution.
  - Explanation: A brief explanation or approach used to solve the problem (if applicable).
  - Complexity Analysis: Time and space complexity of the solution (if provided).

## How to Use
You can browse through the folders to see the solutions. Feel free to use these as a reference, but I encourage you to try solving the problems on your own first!
